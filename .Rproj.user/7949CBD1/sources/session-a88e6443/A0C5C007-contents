# Read the data
data <- read.csv("data/modern-renewable-prod.csv")

# Filter for World
data_long <- data %>%
  filter(Entity == "World") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("Electricity"),
    names_to = "Source",
    values_to = "TWh"
  )

# Plot
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Year, y = TWh, color = Source)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "Renewable Electricity Production of World",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Electricity Production (TWh)") +
  theme_minimal()

## Objectives

This guide demonstrates the use of Git, GitHub, and the command-line interface for collaborative and reproducible practices, using a basic RStudio project setup.

## 1. Create a New RStudio Project

I created a new RStudio Project named Assignment2.

Inside the project folder, I created a file named example.qmd

### Knit to HTML

I used the **Render** button in RStudio to knit `example.qmd` into HTML. The output file `example.html` was successfully generated and previewed.

## 2. Initialise Git Repository and Push to GitHub

In the terminal:

```{bash}
cd 5513_Assignment2
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Quarto file"
```

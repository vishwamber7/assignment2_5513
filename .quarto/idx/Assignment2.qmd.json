Create a New RStudio Project\n\nI created a new RStudio Project named 5513_Assignment2.\n\nInside the project folder, I created a file named example.qmd\n\n### Knit to HTML\n\nI used the **Render** button in RStudio to knit `example.qmd` into HTML. The output file `example.html` was successfully generated and previewed.\n\n![Knitted HTML Output](Images/example_output.png)\n\n## 2. Initialise Git Repository and Push to GitHub\n\nIn the terminal:\n\n```bash\ncd 5513_Assignment2\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit with Quarto file\"\n```\n\n### Create GitHub Repository\n\nI created a new repository on GitHub named assignment2-etcs5513, then added the remote:\n\n```bash\ngit remote add origin <https://github.com/vishwamber7/assignment2-etcs5513.git>\ngit branch -M main\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n## 3. Create a Branch and Modify File\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b testbranch\n```\n\nI modified example.qmd by adding this line under the existing text:\n\n\"This line was added in testbranch.\"\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\ngit add example.qmd\ngit commit -m \"Modified example.qmd in testbranch\"\ngit push -u origin testbranch\n```\n\n## 4. Add Data Folder and Amend Commit\n\nI created a folder called data and added the CSV file from Assignment 1.\n\n```bash\nmkdir data \ncp ../etc5513-assignment-1-vishwamber7Assignment1/modern-renewable-prod.csv data/\ngit add data/modern-renewable-prod.csv\ngit commit --amend --no-edit\ngit push --force\n```\n\n## 5. Conflict Setup in main Branch\n\nSwitching back to main:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout main\n```\n\nI edited example.qmd differently by changing the same section modified in testbranch:\n\n\"This line was added in main branch and will conflict.\"\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\ngit add example.qmd\ngit commit -m \"Conflicting change in example.qmd in main\"\ngit push\n```\n\n## 6. Merge Branch and Fix Conflict\n\n```bash\ngit merge testbranch\n```\n\nThis created a merge conflict in example.qmd. Git output:\n\nAuto-merging example.qmd \\\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in example.qmd \\\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n\nI opened example.qmd and resolved the conflict manually:\n\n\"This line includes content from both branches.\"\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\ngit add example.qmd\ngit commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict between main and testbranch\"\ngit push\n```\n\nConflict resolved and pushed to GitHub.\n\n## 7. Tag Commit\n\n```bash\ngit tag -a v1.0 -m \"Version 1.0 release after merge\"\ngit push origin v1.0\n```\n\n## 8. Delete Branch\n\n```bash\ngit branch -d testbranch\ngit push origin --delete testbranch\n```\n\ntestbranch deleted locally and remotely.\n\n## 9. Condensed Git Log\n\n```bash\ngit log --oneline\n```\n\nOutput:\n\na70ec5e (HEAD -\\> main, tag: v1.0, origin/main) Resolved merge conflict between main and testbranch\\\na70d25b Conflicting change in example.qmd in main \\\nf3dee0b Modified example.qmd in testbranch \\\n5caaed0 Initial commit with Quarto file\n\n## 10. Add Plot and Undo Commit\n\nI added the following to example.qmd:\n\n![Example Plot Code](Images/example_plot.png)\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\ngit add example.qmd \ngit commit -m \"Added simple plot to example.qmd\"\n```\n\nTo undo the commit but keep changes:\n\n```bash\ngit reset --soft HEAD~1 \n```\n\nThe commit was undone, but changes remained in the working directory.\n\n## Summary of Git Skills Demonstrated\n\n-   Git init, add, commit\n\n-   Pushing to GitHub\n\n-   Branching and merging\n\n-   Conflict resolution\n\n-   Amending commits\n\n-   Using tags\n\n-   Deleting branches\n\n-   Condensed git logs\n\n-   Undoing commits with reset\n\n## Clear Commit Messages\n\n-   Commit messages were concise and descriptive:\n\n-   Initial commit with Quarto file\n\n-   Modified example.qmd in testbranch\n\n-   Conflicting change in example.qmd in main\n\n-   Resolved merge conflict between main and testbranch\n\n-   Added simple plot to example.qmd\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis guide demonstrates essential collaborative Git practices, including conflict resolution, branching, tagging, and commit management, ensuring reproducibility and clean version history in data science projects.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Objectives\n\nThis guide demonstrates the use of Git, GitHub, and the command-line interface for collaborative and reproducible practices, using a basic RStudio project setup.\n\n## 1.
